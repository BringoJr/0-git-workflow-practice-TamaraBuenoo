# Git Practice
A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

Create a README.md file in that directory using valid Markdown syntax. Edit this file such that it includes the following:

a link to an article or web site you find interesting related to software development/engineering (indirect relationships are ok)
a paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article
remember that this will be public
Use Markdown syntax to make it look nice
